# isotope-distribution
## Calculates most likely isotope masses, especially for larger compounds

Initially made for siloxanes, including D3/D4/D5/D6/D7 and C12H36O4Si5 (L5 Siloxane), but should be useful for other compounds.

Input: Parent species, not ion. Only accepts C, H, O, N, S, and Si counts.

Output: Writes distribution of isotope ions (by mass) to isotope_dist.csv (in root directory).

Future improvement: Include corresponding formulas in a separate column.
