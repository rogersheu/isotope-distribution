# isotope-distribution
Calculates most likely isotope masses, especially for larger compounds


Roger Sheu
Isotope mass predictor

Initially made for C12H36O4Si5 (L5 Siloxane), but should be useful for other compounds

Put in parent species, not ion.

Output: Writes distribution of isotope ions (by mass) to isotope_dist.csv (in root directory)

Future improvement: Include formulas in a separate column
